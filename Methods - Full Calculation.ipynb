    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduced-order economic analysis estimates the total construction, operation, and energy storage costs of wide scale implementation of Agrivoltaic Systems in the United States. Additionally, estimates are made for potential job creation, emissions reduction, and total required land area of these systems. This analysis does not consider impacts stemming from building material availability or macro economic impacts of wide scale manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their 2012 Renewable Futures study the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) projects that it is possible for the U.S. to meet 80% of total electricity demand in 2050 using renewable energy technologies, with up to  12.7% of the total generation coming from PV sources in their \"High-Demand\" scenario ([5](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/re-futures.html)).  Two-thirds of the total Solar PV capacity is anticipated to come from Utility PV with the other 30% coming from rooftop PV. In the interests of an upperbound estimate we are analyzing a scenario where 20% of total electricity generation is being met with utility PV via Agrivoltaics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Procedure\n",
    "1) 2019 Domestic electricity production is estimated to be 4120 TWH based on the United States Energy Information Administration data ([1](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20about%204%2C118%20billion,facilities%20in%20the%20United%20States.&text=About%2063%25%20of%20this%20electricity,%2C%20petroleum%2C%20and%20other%20gases.))\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Total required nameplate capacity is calculated using the equation\n",
    " \n",
    " \\begin{equation*} \\text{Capacity Factor} = \\frac{ \\text{Energy Generated AC}}{\\text{Time period}*\\frac{\\text{Capacity DC}}{\\text{Derate Factor}}} \\end{equation*} \n",
    " \n",
    "3) The total solar array costs is estimated assuming a cost of 2 dollars/ watt for capital expenditures and 19 / kW/ year for operation and maintence ([2](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2020/data.php))\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Energy storage costs are calculated based on NREL lithium-ion standalone storage cost model ([3](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/71714.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Potential returns are estimated assuming a constant energy price\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Total solar array area (ha) required to meet this demand is estimated based on National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL)  land use requirements ([4](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56290.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Required solar array area is doubled with the assumption that Agrivoltaic Systems will have half the panel density of traditional systems ([5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211501103X))\n",
    "\n",
    "7) All Results are reported in 2020 dollars adjusted using Consumer Price Index ([6](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm))\n",
    "\n",
    "8) CO2 emissions are estimated by comparing emissions per kWh produced by the grid ([7](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11#:~:text=In2018%2CtotalU.S.electricity,ofCO2emissionsperkWh.)) to emissions per kWh produced from solar PV ([8](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/)) \n",
    "\n",
    "9) Potential for job creation was estimated using lifecycle employement factors (person-years per GWh) from ([9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117306676))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Major Assumptions\n",
    "1) The grid can handle the increased solar generation\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Building resources are sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Capacity Factor for solar arrays is assumed to be 24.5 ([10](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_6_07_b)) \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Derate factor to convert nameplate DC capacity to AC capacity is assumed to be 0.85 ([4](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56290.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "5) 'Average' land use requirements for Large Photovoltaic arrays are used (note this is ignoring solar variability throughout the US)\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Agrivoltaic arrays have half the panel density of traditional arrays and thus require twice the land use of traditional arrays to produce the same quantity of energy\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Only 60 MW stand alone Lithium-ion battery arrays are used for storage ([3](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/71714.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Batteries and inverter are replaced every 10 years\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Macro economic impacts of large scale Agrivoltaic systems are not considered\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Yearly inflation rate of 2.5% for operation and maintenance costs \n",
    "\n",
    "9) Discount rate = 6.0 %\n",
